. "$PSScriptRoot\scripts\publish-project.ps1"

### This script will publish your project to work for the development environment.
### By default, this script will compile the core project, and generate a todo list and decorate summary in the logs folder.
### The configuration used can be modified, but if you want to go further and add or remove options, it is a better idea to look at `publish-template.ps1`.

### Note this script is an example. It compiles the three projects for each compiler (acc, bcc, gdcc) and also runs the tool through the resources.

# Set this to $false if you want to be warned of forward references.
# Note ACSUtils has these, and enabling this means that you will have a lot of existing warnings.
$noWarnForwardReferences = $true;

# The relative path of the location of the core project containing the ACS files that are made for GDCC.
$gdccProjectPath = "TestProjectGdccAcc";

# The relative path of the location of the core project containing the ACS files that are made for BCC.
$bccProjectPath = "TestProjectBcc";

# The relative path of the location of the core project containing the ACS files that are made for ACC.
$accProjectPath = "TestProjectAcc";

# The relative path of the location of the maps project containing the main resources.
